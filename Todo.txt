fix mate and check to feature stalemate, also fix the white_in_mate boolean because it's not currect for stalemate (
maybe use return from mate in movePiece and not update the bool in mate)

simulate moves is inefficient because it calculates all legal moves 2 times

minimax:
    in lines 406 and 408 print different matrixes for some reason



change calculate check to scan to all directions from king, and the checking the pieces that collide with the scan
add pawn promotion
add castling
