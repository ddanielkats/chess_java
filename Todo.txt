simulate moves is inefficient because it calculates all legal moves 2 times
when calculating legal moves, remember all moves that contain a king, and the calculate check will be more efficient

minimax:
    add the fact that the team with most threats gets 1 point
    add bonus to eat with pawn rather than with other piece
    punish for eating with king (making king more exposed) [add king safety bonus]
    add alpha-beta pruning
    when black gets mated it errors
    moves update weirdly when calculating for some reason


change calculate check to scan to all directions from king, and the checking the pieces that collide with the scan
add pawn promotion
add castling
